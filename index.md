Hi! I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Economics department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. My primary field of interest is empirical industrial organization. I am also interested in health economics, behavioral economics, and marketing. My research applies tools of empirical IO to topics such as sorting, vertical contracts, and spillovers across policy settings, including pharmaceuticals, transportation, electric vehicles, and digital platforms.

[comment]: <> (I will be on the job market in the 2023-24 and am available for interviews, including at the ASSA 2024 Annual Meeting on January 6-8, 2024.)

My main advisor is [Panle Barwick](https://www.pbarwick.org/).
