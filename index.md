Hi! I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Economics department at University of Wisconsin at Madison. My primary field of interest is empirical industrial organization. I am also interested in health economics, behavioral economics, and marketing. My research applies tools of empirical IO to topics such as sorting, vertical contracts, and spillovers across policy settings including pharmaceuticals, transportation, electric vehicles, and digital platforms.
